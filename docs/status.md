## Handoff rules

Use `not_started`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, or `complete`. Record exact commands,
results, platform/toolchain, and relevant commit or files. Record manual desktop
checks separately. An unavailable check is pending, not a pass. Mark complete only
when acceptance criteria have evidence.

For each handoff record completed behavior, changed files, check results,
reproducible blockers, approved deviations, and the smallest next action.

The [acceptance matrix](acceptance-matrix.md) tracks release requirements. Planned
tests in milestone documents are not evidence of implemented application behavior.

## Foundation preparation — 2026-09-26

Completed: README/navigation, canonical agent workflow, all nine milestone contract
revisions, acceptance/dependency tracking, and the stdlib-only documentation checker.
`Cargo.lock` will be tracked. The machine-local `.codegraph` symlink is ignored and
removed from the Git index; its on-disk symlink and index data remain available.
The blueprint's architecture and milestone sequence are retained.

### Automated checks

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `python3 scripts/check-docs.py` | PASS: 17 Markdown files, 33 local link targets, 66 numbered blueprint references; all 17 CLI methods mapped in IPC table |
| `git diff --check` | PASS: no whitespace errors |
| `git diff --cached --check` | PASS: staged local-index removal has no whitespace errors |
| `git check-ignore --no-index .codegraph` | Matches `.codegraph`, as intended |
| `git check-ignore --no-index Cargo.lock` | No match, as intended |

Manual consistency review covered feature ownership, command/protocol agreement,
domain/runtime dependency direction, recovery behavior, and completion gates.
The checker validates local path existence, not remote URL availability or heading
anchors. No remote dependency/API verification was performed in this planning pass.

### Desktop and Rust validation

Not applicable to this documentation/tooling change: no application/Cargo workspace
exists. No Cargo or Wayland test results are claimed. The next implementation task
is M1 dependency research and a minimal GPUI window; record the selected revisions,
licenses, native packages, build checks, and actual Wayland observations there.

## Milestone 1 — GPUI Boot — 2026-09-26

Implemented a Cargo workspace containing only `apps/omaterm`, a GPUI 0.2.2 desktop
binary, and CI quality checks. The `omaterm-desktop` binary opens a titled OmaTerm
window with a dark root background and centered text. Both GPUI Linux backends are
explicitly compiled; no domain, terminal, IPC, or configuration code was added.

### Changed files

- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `rust-toolchain.toml`
- `apps/omaterm/Cargo.toml` and `apps/omaterm/src/main.rs`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `docs/dependencies.md` and this status record

### Automated checks

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo build --workspace` | PASS: completed with GPUI `wayland` and `x11` features enabled |
| `cargo fmt --all --check` | PASS |
| `cargo test --workspace` | PASS: 0 tests, 0 failures |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` | PASS |
| `cargo tree -e features -p omaterm` | PASS: reports GPUI 0.2.2 `wayland` and `x11` features |
| `python3 scripts/check-docs.py` | PASS: 17 Markdown files, 33 local links, 66 blueprint references, 17 CLI/IPC mappings |
| `git diff --check` | PASS |

Cargo emits a future-incompatibility notice for transitive `proc-macro-error2`
2.0.1. It does not fail the build or Clippy gate; retain it as a dependency-update
item rather than treating it as a passing-free warning.

### Desktop and platform validation

| Environment | Result |
|---|---|
| Omarchy Linux 7.2.5-3-omarchy, Hyprland Wayland (`wayland-1`) | PASS: native Wayland client mapped with title `OmaTerm`; a window-only `grim` capture confirmed the dark surface and centered `OmaTerm` text |
| X11 | PASS (build coverage): GPUI `x11` feature compiled in the workspace build; no X11 session was available for runtime testing |
| Window close | PASS: manual Omarchy validation used Super+W while monitoring btop; the window closed and `omaterm-desktop` exited cleanly. |

### Next action

Implement the pure, GPUI-independent pane tree defined by Milestone 2.

## Milestone 2 — Pure Pane Tree — 2026-09-26

Implemented `omaterm-core`, a GPUI-independent recursive pane-tree crate. It owns
typed pane/split/session identifiers; checked tree construction; split, remove,
resize, find, enumeration, ancestor, normalized geometry, directional-neighbor,
and equalize operations; and nine unit tests. The desktop now renders nested,
colored placeholder panes directly from this model. Keyboard actions call the same
core operations: `Ctrl+Shift+R` split right, `Ctrl+Shift+D` split down,
`Ctrl+Shift+W` close, `Ctrl+Shift+H/J/K/L` focus, `Ctrl+{`/`Ctrl+}` resize the
innermost containing split (physically `Ctrl+Shift+[`/`Ctrl+Shift+]` on US layout;
GPUI receives `ctrl-{`/`ctrl-}` since Shift has already been applied to the
character), and `Ctrl+Shift+E` equalize.

### Changed files

- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `apps/omaterm/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/omaterm-core/Cargo.toml` and `crates/omaterm-core/src/{lib,ids,error,pane}.rs`
- `apps/omaterm/src/main.rs`
- `docs/dependencies.md` and this status record

### Automated checks

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo fmt --all --check` | PASS |
| `cargo test -p omaterm-core` | PASS: 9 pane-tree tests, 0 failures |
| `cargo test --workspace` | PASS: 9 tests, 0 failures |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` | PASS |
| `cargo build --workspace` | PASS |
| `python3 scripts/check-docs.py` | PASS: 17 Markdown files, 33 local link targets, 66 numbered blueprint references; all 17 CLI methods mapped in IPC table |
| `git diff --check` | PASS |

Cargo continues to report the existing transitive `proc-macro-error2` 2.0.1
future-incompatibility notice during workspace test/build commands. It does not
fail the quality gate.

### Desktop and platform validation

Wayland manual validation completed 2026-09-26: split right/down, nested geometry,
close/collapse including last pane → empty-root message, HJKL focus navigation,
`Ctrl+{`/`Ctrl+}` resize, and `Ctrl+Shift+E` equalize all confirmed working on
Omarchy/Hyprland. Two corrections applied during validation:
- Fractional split-child wrappers made flex containers so panes fill their
  full allocated rectangles.
- Resize shortcuts: originally `Ctrl+Alt+H/L` (collided with Omarchy's
  completion notification), then `Ctrl+Shift+[`/`Ctrl+Shift+]` (Shift combines
  with `[`/`]` producing `{`/`}` on US layout), now bound as `ctrl-{`/`ctrl-}`
  so GPUI resolves the physical `Ctrl+Shift+[`/`Ctrl+Shift+]` correctly.

| Environment | Result |
|---|---|
| Omarchy Linux 7.2.5-3-omarchy, Hyprland Wayland | PASS: all M2 keyboard interactions confirmed |
| X11 | PASS (build coverage): GPUI `x11` feature compiled; no X11 session available |

### Next action

Begin M3: PTY + alacritty_terminal + single terminal GPUI rendering.
